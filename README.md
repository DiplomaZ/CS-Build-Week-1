## What is Conway's Game of Life?

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive or dead. The game follows four simple rules, which determine whether a cell is alive or dead in the next generation.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
5. Click on the cells to toggle between alive and dead, or use the "Randomize" button to generate a random starting pattern.
6. Click on the "Start" button to begin the simulation.

## Custom Hooks

This implementation of Conway's Game of Life utilizes custom hooks, which allow for more flexible and reusable code. The `useGrid` hook handles the game grid and its state, while the `useInterval` hook controls the simulation speed.

## React Canvas

To improve performance and rendering speed, this project uses React Canvas, which allows for efficient drawing and manipulation of pixels on the canvas.

## Double Buffering

Double buffering is a technique used to eliminate flickering and improve animation smoothness. This project implements double buffering to ensure a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.
